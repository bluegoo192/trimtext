TrimText
A fast, extensible text editor for programmers on all platforms

1. Instructions on building and running TrimText.
    Required Libraries:
    Required Operating System: N/A

2. No external data files are required for this project. TrimText can open (as far as we know) any file type out there. Just navigate to whatever file you wish to open and it will open it. Files to be opened do not need to be placed in the same location as the TrimText source code or runnable.

3. Known Bugs: HTML website preview button only supports raw text, Undo and Redo occasionally will delete too much or too little
   Additional Info: Large files may take a long time to open. All new files are started with a default name with nothing inside. Color        button currently does not function. Exit button will automatically save and close all files.
   
4. Instructions: Once the text editor is open, just type away into the interface and text will show up. You can open many file types and the editor will automatically import the text with basic formatting. You can save modfications done to these files as well. You can change the size and type of font used in the text through our menu bar under the Font button under the View button. You can live preview the text inside the editor on a webpage as well through the Web Page button under the View button. The New button will generate a empty tab and the Save and Exit button will do exactly what they say. Save will save your tabs and Exit will save and close the entire interface. You can also freely swap between tabs by clicking through the tabs and close whichever ones you want by clicking the X button in each tab.
